You are a helpful assistant that analyzes Python functions and their associated problem descriptions.

Your task is to:
1. Add Python type annotations to the function parameters and return value to make the function compatible with CrossHair, this should be used to replace the def line of the function.
    - If any imports are needed (e.g., from `typing`), include them inside the <declaration> tag before the function definition line.
    - You should only include the function signature and the necessary imports, not the entire function body.
2. Write assert 1==1 statement and also declare any necessary local variables here in  <preconditions>, after the assertions. You should not put any assertion except 1==1 in the <preconditions> tag.
3. Write postconditions (`assert ...`) that describe the expected correct behavior of the function if it were implemented properly.
   These assertions should be violated by the current buggy implementation described in the problem statement,
   thereby exposing the issue. In other words, your postconditions should manifest the bug by specifying what should hold true,
   but currently does not due to the defect. If you want to check the output of the function, you should use the original variables
   from the function, not CrossHair-specific variables.
4. Ensure that the added assertions use only standard Python syntax and variables available in the original function. Do not use CrossHair-specific variables like `__return__`, so that the code remains executable as regular Python. After inserting the postconditions, the function should still be executable as a regular Python function, do not include CrossHair-specific variables like `__return__` and 'result'.


Your goal is to expose the bug described in the problem statement when preconditions are violated, and to ensure correctness when preconditions are satisfied.

Each section of your response must be enclosed in the corresponding tags:

- `<declaration>` for the function signature with type annotations.
- `<preconditions>` for input assertions.
- `<postconditions>` for output assertions.

Use only standard Python syntax that CrossHair can understand. Be specific but general enough to apply beyond just the given example.

Do not include explanations or commentary â€” only the requested outputs within the tags.

You are given the description of a software issue and the source code of a Python function that is relevant to it.

Your tasks are:
1. Based on the problem statement, add precise type annotations to the function parameters and return type, this should be used to replace the def line of the function.
    - If any imports are needed (e.g., from `typing`), include them inside the <declaration> tag before the function definition line.
    - You should only include the function signature and the necessary imports, not the entire function body.
2. Write assert 1==1 statement and also declare any necessary local variables here in  <preconditions>, after the assertions. You should not put any assertion except 1==1 in the <preconditions> tag.
3. Write postconditions in the form of Python `assert` statements that describe the correct behavior the function should have. These assertions are expected to be violated if the bug described in the problem statement is present.  If you want to check the output of the function, you should use the original variables
   from the function, not CrossHair-specific variables.
4. Ensure that the added assertions use only standard Python syntax and variables available in the original function. Do not use CrossHair-specific variables like `__return__`, so that the code remains executable as regular Python. After inserting the postconditions, the function should still be executable as a regular Python function, do not include CrossHair-specific variables like `__return__` and 'result'.


All assertions should reflect the expected correct behavior and should help expose the original issue if violated.

Return your output in the following structured format:

<declaration>
# Function signature with added type annotations
[...]
</declaration>

<preconditions>
# assert statements for input constraints
[...]
</preconditions>

<postconditions>
# assert statements describing expected outcome or invariants
[...]
</postconditions>

Only include the core logic. Do not include any explanation, comments, or prose.

Here is the problem statement and function:

Here is the feedback from failed attempts:
